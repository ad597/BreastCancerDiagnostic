In this project, I will develop a machine learning-based tool that aids in the diagnosis and visualization of breast cancer types from biopsy data. I will be using the Breast Cancer Dataset from UCI. The tool will employ K-means clustering on PCA-reduced data, logistic regression, and anomaly detection with the Isolation Forest algorithm. These techniques will help in identifying patterns, classifying data, and detecting potential outliers or rare cases in the dataset.
